This folder contains the sourcecode to train the Neural Network described in Fehling et al. (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0227791) 
and to generate predictions accordingly. Tensorflow 1.8.0 or higher, Python 3.x and the following libraries are required: 
- skimage (from scikit-image)
- scipy (from scikit-image)
- numpy 
- pillow
Additionally, to train the U-LSTM_5_CE two GPUs with computing capability of CUDA 5.1 or higher are mandatory.
